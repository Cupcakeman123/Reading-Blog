            My favourite hobby is reading. I enjoy reading a book when I am free.The teachers always 
            taught me to read the difficult words. I enjoy reading because I like to explore 
            the imaginative world of my favourite author, J.K.Rowling who writes “ Harry Potter” . 
            There are a lot of advantages of reading. I can also learn new vocabulary items. Moreover, 
            it can give me an unlimited imagination!
